/**Assume an electric vehicle must go from source city s to destination city d. You can locate many service centers
 *  along the journey that allow for the replacement of batteries; however, each service center provides batteries
 *  with a specific capacity. You are given a 2D array in which servicecenter[i]=[xi,yj] indicates that the ith service
 *  center is xi miles from the source city and offers yj miles after the automobile can travel after replacing batteries
 *  at specific service centers. Return the number of times the car's batteries need to be replaced before arriving at the destination.
 *  Input: serviceCenters = [{10,60},{20,30},{30,30},{60,40}], targetMiles= 100, startChargeCapacity = 10
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The car can go 10 miles on its initial capacity; after 10 miles, the car replaces batteries with a capacity of 60 miles;
 and after travelling 50 miles, at position 60 we change batteries with a capacity of 40 miles; and ultimately, we may arrive at our destination.**/
